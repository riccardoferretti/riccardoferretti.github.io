# DeFi Primer

Start date: [[2021-03-29]]
Goal: learn more about the latest in crypto, from DeFi to NFTs to how the space is evolving in general, even beyond finance.

I have decided to learn more about crypto in general, and DeFi specifically. And I have decided to experiment learning about it in public.
There are a few goals I have set myself up for this project:
- review what I already know about crypto (minor)
- understand the major current developments in DeFi
- create a mental model about where the space is headed
- see in which other domains the innovations of DeFi will likely apply next, that is, to see how just as DeFi is addressing a lot of the wrong systems and incentives in finance, DeGov could do the same for politics and governments, of DeSoc to social networks, and so on...

There are also some unrelated objectives I will be pursuing during this project:
- learn in public
- publish a digital garden on the topic
- (bonus) join the 1729.com movement


## My approach

I have created a (private) blockchain centric list on my twitter, but as I feel I don't have enough context to understand some (most) of the things coming out of those twitter accounts, I get started by auditing some classes on Coursera:
